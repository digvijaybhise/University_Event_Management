This is a Spring Boot project for managing university events and students attending the events. The project uses an in-memory H2 database for data storage.

---
<br>

## Framework Used
* Spring Boot

---
<br>

## Language Used
* Java

---
<br>

## Data Model

The project has two models:
```

Student
studentId (generated by the system)
firstName
lastName
age (between 18 - 25)
department (Enum: ME, ECE, civil, CSE)
```

```
Event
eventId (generated by the system)
eventName
locationOfEvent
date
startTime
endTime

```

### Validation

To validate the input we get from client, we've used validation annotations that are used to enforce specific constraints on the values of the variables. These constraints ensure that the data input by the user is of the correct format and meets certain criteria.

* @Valid - In Spring Framework, the @Valid annotation is used in conjunction with @PostMapping and @PutMapping annotations, which are used to handle POST and PUT requests, respectively. When used with @PostMapping or @PutMapping, the @Valid annotation is typically applied to a method parameter annotated with @RequestBody.

* @NotEmpty: This annotation is used to validate that the annotated field is not null or empty. 

* @NotNull: This annotation is used to validate that the annotated field is not null.

* @Length: It is a validation annotation that can be used to ensure that a string value meets certain length requirements (Between 4 to 255 here). It is used to validate input data in web applications.

* @Pattern: It is used to validate that the code field matches the regular expression pattern

## Data Flow

1. The user at client side sends a request to the application through the API endpoints.
2. The API receives the request and sends it to the appropriate controller method.
3. The controller method makes a call to the method in service class.

4. The method in service class builds logic and retrieves or modifies data from the database, which is in turn given to controller class
5. The controller method returns a response to the API.
6. The API sends the response back to the user.

## API End Points (Event)

</br>

### Inbuilt @CrudRepo methods
- We're extending CRUDRepository into repository interface.

* PostMapping: "/events"
```
This endpoint makes a call to method in eventService class where we implement method "saveAll()" in CRUD Repository.
```

* PutMapping : "events/{id}"
```
This endpoint makes a call to method in eventService class which is connected to database. In database we update a event by id given through API.
```

* DeleteMapping : "events/{id}"
```
This endpoint makes a call to method in eventService class which is connected to database. In database we delete a user by id given through API by using deleteById method.
```


</br>

### Custom get methods using custom finders (based on method names)
- Custom finder methods are defined in a library to get the data so we don't have to write sql queries to get the data.

* GetMapping : "/events"
```
The user is requesting data to be filtered by date. We've used custom method findByDate to get the data from database.
```

</br>


## API End Points (Event)

<br>


### Inbuilt @CrudRepo methods
- We're extending CRUDRepository into repository interface.

* PostMapping: "students"
```
This endpoint makes a call to method in studentService class where we implement method "saveAll()" in CRUD Repository.
```


* GetMapping: "students/id"
```
This endpoint makes a call to method in studentService class where we implement method "findAll()" if id not given, & findById(id) method in CRUD Repository if id is given.
```


* DeleteMapping : "student/{id}"
```
This endpoint makes a call to method in studentService class which is connected to database. In database we delete a user by id given through API by using deleteById method.
```



### Operations using custom queries (using @Query)


* PutMapping : "student/{id}/{department}"
```
We're using this mapping to get students by id and update department for that particular student. Here we've used custom SQL query to update data in our database
```
---
<br>


## DataBase Used
* H2 database
```
We have used InMemory database H2 to implement CRUD Operations.
```

## Project Summary

The University Event Management System is a project that stores data related to students and events in a university. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing the data and can be easily extended to support additional features.

The project provides several endpoints to interact with the data, such as adding a student, updating a student's department, deleting a student, getting all students, getting a student by Id, adding an event, updating an event, deleting an event, getting all events, and getting all events on a specific date.

Overall, the University Event Management System provides a comprehensive solution for managing students and events in a university. The project can be easily extended to support additional features as needed, and the use of a database ensures that the data is stored securely and can be easily accessed and managed.
